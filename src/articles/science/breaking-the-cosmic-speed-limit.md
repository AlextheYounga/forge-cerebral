# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

>*"We knew a million things we could hardly understand."*

### Introduction

300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern
science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its
origins or even how to defend it.

But even Einstein himself struggled to defend this point, and those who
studied his life claim he wrestled with this idea *to the point of
despair.*

That is because, as I will make the case here, it is not a logically
coherent position.

It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that has
made much of modern theoretical physics unintelligible and unworkable.
To pull on this thread is liable to unravel much of modern physics.

This postulate requires additional theories like time dilation and
length contraction in order to remain logically valid, but these
theories bring an even greater number of paradoxes --- which again
require additional theories to resolve. We have spent a century
basically kicking the scientific can down the road instead of
reexamining our underlying assumptions - the evidence for which was
never as concrete as we have been conditioned to believe.

What I\'m claiming is heresy of the highest order. When I pitched this
idea to friends, their gut reactions were: *don\'t write that, you\'ll
lose all credibility.* And they\'re right.

Here's what you\'re likely thinking:

*We have over 100 years worth of investigation, experimentation and
intellectual rigor from the world\'s greatest minds, and probably 99% of
physicists today agree with the constant velocity of light. But you, guy
on the internet, has discovered it was all wrong?*

I felt the same thing when I encountered the people who would eventually
come to convince me. *How could we be this wrong!?*

The same way man has been wrong about so many things.

## Abstract

My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light postulate is riddled with logical
    paradoxes that can only be reconciled with theories containing more
    logical paradoxes.

2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved that light speed is
    fundamentally constant.

3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian
    mechanics.

## The First Problem

**The Mainstream Claim:**

> Light has a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

What this means, simply put, is that it does not matter how fast an
emitter of light is moving, light will always travel at the same speed.
It is like saying that a bullet fired from a moving gun is traveling at
the same speed as if it were fired from a stationary gun.

This is a logically impossible claim on its own. The velocity of the
emitter cannot be ignored without consequence.

Here is how Einstein himself described the situation. Here, Einstein is
imagining a carriage that is moving in the same direction as a light
beam, and the consequences of how this would effect the light beam.

**RELATIVITY THE SPECIAL AND GENERAL THEORY (pg 23)\
---ALBERT EINSTEIN**

The only thing that should be shocking about this statement is
Einstein's description of the logically incoherent and mind-bending
relativity principle as somehow more *"natural and simple*".
