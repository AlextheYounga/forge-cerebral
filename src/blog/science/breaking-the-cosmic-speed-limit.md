# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

### Introduction
300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its origins, and most importantly, that it has always been an **assumption**.

The constant velocity of light is first and foremost a mathematical convenience. We cannot make the error of confusing mathematical pragmatism with fundamental truth. An empirical equation of a phenomenon is never an explanation or the cause of that phenomenon. A real explanation must answer the question of causality, which is asked by "why?".

It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that builds the foundation of all relativity theory, and it is this postulate that has made much of modern theoretical physics unintelligible and unworkable. To pull on this thread underminesZz nearly a century of thought.

The assumption of the constant velocity of light requires additional assumptions, like time dilation and length contraction, in order to remain logically valid. But these theories bring an even greater number of paradoxes which again require additional theories to resolve. This is a sign that we are barking up the wrong tree and must reexamine our underlying assumptions. And when we do that, what we find is that light probably isn't as special as we might think. 

## Abstract
My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light postulate is riddled with unresolvable logical paradoxes.
2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved that light speed is fundamentally constant.
3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian mechanics.


## What Relativity Is And Isn't
It is not true to say that Relativity overturned the Newtonian paradigm. Physics is, as a rule, Newtonian, and only in a few special cases do we decide to diverge from his principles.

Relativity is largely an extension of Newtonian mechanics. Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, (E = mc2), is nothing that Newton would have disagreed with. Though Newton did not pursue this particular problem with the same vigor as Einstein, Newton speculated that mass and energy were likely equivalent.

In 1704 Sir Isaac Newton wrote in his revolutionary book “Opticks”:

>"Do not Bodies and Light act mutually upon one another that is to say, Bodies upon Light in emitting, reflecting, refracting and inflecting it, and Light upon Bodies for heating them, and putting their parts into a vibrating motion wherein heat consists?" 
>"Gross bodies and light are convertible into one another..."

There are many aspects of Relativity that people seem to think conflict with Newtonian mechanics, such as gravitational lensing, redshifting and blueshifting of light, and black holes. All of which can be explained within the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics, even if Newton's original measurements were somewhat incorrect. 

All of relativity falls, squarely, on a single assumption: the speed of light is constant. It is only by logical necessity of this first assumption that space and time must be relative. On its own, the constant velocity of light is an incoherent position, unless space and time are relative.

The real debate falls to a single point: the constant velocity of light. It was this assumption that necessitates relative space and relative time, because a constant velocity of light is an incoherent position without those two additional theories. So the entirety of relativity falls to a single position, and only by logical extension of this first assumption do we get relative space and time. 


## A Quick Note on Logic
I need the reader to understand a very important principle, because when I point out later how relativity violates this principle, we can be certain this theory is unworkable. 

In logic, there is a very important rule, arguably the most important rule of all, called “the law of identity.” This rule is very simple.

>Things are the way that they are, and they are not the way they are not.

The question is, how do we know what is real? How do we know what must be true?

If something defies this rule, we can be certain it is wrong. If things are no longer the way they are, the universe itself becomes unworkable. As long as existence continues, the universe is coherent. If we lose coherence, we ultimately must lose existence itself.

Do you disagree? Tell me then if something can exist and not exist at the same time. Look past the words - think of the concept of existence and the concept of non-existence, and explain how these two concepts are compatible in any shape or form.

This is a true metaphysical impossibility. It is not only false in this universe, but in all possible universes.

Logic is a property of existence. If something exists, it has features of existence, and those features have properties. Those properties are what we call logic. For instance, an object exists, and it has the features of 4 equal sides. One of the properties of having 4 equal sides is that it can never have the feature of roundness. That's logic. 

My thinking about it has nothing to do with it, it is true regardless of thought. It doesn't matter what universe you place this object, if it has 4 equal sides, it will never have the features of roundness.

This is what Schrodinger was trying to explain to the Copenhagen physicists with his famous cat thought experiment, but the point went over their heads. Many of them still don't really understand it. They ironically parade the idea around like a talking point for the complexity of the universe. He was trying to tell them they were wrong, and they were wrong. Thankfully the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics has now started to fall out of favor due to its many logical conundrums. 

This is not complex, but it's also not intuitive. It's perhaps the simplest thing imaginable, the most irreducible property of existence.

## Part 1: The Logic
> Light has a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

The mainstream scientific perspective states confidently that light is constant in all inertial reference frames, which is to say that it does not matter how fast the source of the light is moving - it will remain constant.

An example of an inertial reference frame is driving down a flat desert road and setting your cruise control at 50mph. In this frame the driver is undergoing no acceleration. Assuming the car has Cadillac suspension, the only way the driver can discern that he is actually moving is by witnessing the tumbleweeds go by. Indeed, if your vehicle was large enough you could even play ping pong without issue. On earth we never feel as though we are moving because any acceleration we experience is so gradual that we can hardly detect it.

Okay, so now let us examine this idea of a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

If we fire a 9mm handgun from a stationary position, we will record a speed of about 850mph. Now imagine firing the same handgun out the front of your vehicle moving at 50mph. From your perspective in the driver seat, you will also record a velocity of 850mph. However, our man in the stationary position will record a velocity of 900mph.

This is intuitive. An object's velocity cannot be logically dissociated from the speed of its source - we can't simply disregard the car. The speed of the source would then be v = v1 + v2, meaning the total speed would be equal to the velocity of the bullet, plus the velocity of the emitter. This is the simple, intuitive Newtonian physics of the everyday world around us.

But Einstein claims that light does not behave this way. The speed of the bullet would be equal to 850mph in both instances, he claims. It wouldn't even matter if the car was driving at 850mph. Both the driver would record a speed of 850mph, and the person standing still would also record a speed of 850mph.

How can this be? Well, it can't - not by itself. Even Einstein will tell you that this assertion by itself makes no logical sense whatsoever. 

Here is Einstein himself explaining this very problem by imagining what would happen if we were to measure a light beam moving in the same direction as a moving carriage.

RELATIVITY THE SPECIAL AND GENERAL THEORY (pg 23)\
    -ALBERT EINSTEIN

There is no debate that this notion, on its own, is logically invalid. The only way any of this becomes workable is by adding two new ideas: length contraction and time dilation. 

### Length Contraction
The best way that I have heard to explain the real consequences of length contraction is by imagining you are at the beach. First, let's talk about what a normal day at a very familiar Newtonian beach looks like, where all the physics makes sense, and then we will envision a beach that satisfies Einstein.

We will do just a little bit of math, but it is very simple math, no need to worry. If you're familiar with basic physics, this might be worth skipping over, but I should warn you that things will get weird here very soon, and it may be worth reviewing the basics.

#### A Day at an Einsteinian Beach
Consider standing on the shore of what we might call, an Einsteinian beach, where the ocean takes on relativistic properties. 

First, let's remind ourselves of a normal beach. 

Standing on the shore of the beach, you watch the waves roll towards you, a new wave crashing every second. We’ll say this is the frequency of the ocean, 1 wave per second, (or 1ƒ).

Between each wave is about **2 meters**, so the wavelength will be 2, (or 2λ, with the symbol λ). From here, we have all we need to obtain the speed of the ocean waves. 

>**The speed of a wave is equal to frequency × wavelength. (ƒλ)**

We can calculate the speed of the waves with the following: 1ƒ × 2λ equals 2 meters per second (m/s). The waves are traveling at a speed of 2 m/s.

Now, imagine that you begin walking out into the ocean. You notice that the waves can no longer be passing you by at 2 m/s. Where the waves were rolling onto the beach at one wave per second, you notice that 2 waves crash into your body every one second. From your perspective, the waves are now passing by at an increased frequency. 

So now, in relation to our moving position, it would appear from our perspective as if the waves are moving at a speed of 2ƒ × 2λ = 4 m/s. Again, the waves are still moving at 2 m/s in relation to the beach, but from our now forward-moving perspective, they are now moving faster with relation to us.

This is intuitive, this is what we're all used to.

Now let's visit the bizarre Einsteinian beach. On this beach, the waves will never move faster than 2 m/s, *under no circumstances. On this beach, a wave faster than 2 m/s in any perspective is physically impossible.

So we walk towards the waves on our Einsteinian beach, and something insane happens. 

Suddenly, right before our eyes, the entire landscape of the ocean changes. Every wavelength now contracts to 1 meter in length in order to maintain our original speed of 2 m/s.

This is not a perception issue either, the ocean is now physically different. The distance between each wave is now physically shorter. Space itself adjusts in response to the observer's movement. The formula for wave speed, ƒ * λ, remains constant due to adjustments in wavelength corresponding to changes in frequency from the observer's motion.

Now, as we're walking into the ocean, let's imagine there is another person standing on the Einsteinian beach, and they are witnessing us walk out into the ocean. What do they see? Will they see the ocean contract in response to our movement?

No, According to relativity and the "Lorentz Transformation" mathematics it utilizes, that observer will watch us become thinner, not the ocean contracting. Remember, this is not simply a matter of perspective, the observer on the beach will never be able to agree with our measurements, and we will never be able to agree with their measurements. 

Einstein would claim that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, but as we will soon see, this is impossible under the relativistic paradigm. If relativity is true, then you must also believe that the universe offers up two distinct, incompatible versions of reality for each observer. 

So, to recap, from this thought experiment we can gather that, based on our velocity, the universe seems to present us alternative versions of reality. Length is no longer an objective property of the universe. On our Einsteinian beach, the ocean itself contracts in response to our movement towards it, and this is not simply the appearance of the ocean contracting - space itself has actually changed. And for the stationary observer watching us, they will see no such change in the ocean, but a change only in the length of the moving object or observer.

#### The Flash Runs By A Slow Motion Camera
Just in case there is any confusion left about the mainstream positions of relativity, here is one more short thought experiment that should sum up the theory nicely.

Imagine a square room, 50 feet by 50 feet in area, containing two people. One of these people is The Flash, who can sprint at speeds approaching the speed of light. The other person is someone with a slow motion camera capable of capturing The Flash while at high speed.

The Flash proceeds to run near the speed of light to the opposite side of the room. The Flash is able to reach speeds resulting in a Lorentz transformation factor of 10, meaning that in the eyes of the FLash, the opposite side of the room is now only 5 feet ahead of him. 

From the perspective of the stationary cameraman, The Flash, the man himself, is now only a sliver of himself, thinned to a horrific 1/10 of his original width.

From these two perspectives, neither man can agree as to the objective size of the room, as length is no longer an objective property of the universe.

### The Consequences of Relative Space
Imagine a train must occasionally pass over a bridge. This bridge is 1/10 the length of the train. The engineers never considered making the bridge strong enough to support more than 1/10 section of train at a time, as 1/10 of a train is all that could ever fit on the bridge at any given moment. 

But time has passed and there has been a major breakthrough. Someone has invented a train that can travel at near light speed, and they've appropriately named it The Solar Express. 

The Solar Express can achieve speeds so great that it experiences a Lorentz transformation factor of 10, meaning it will contract to 1/10 of its original size as it reaches this speed. 

An engineer points out that this is a serious problem, as the bridge it will have to pass over can only support 1/10 of the bridge. From the engineer's perspective, standing stationary watching the bridge, the entire train will indeed be able to fit onto the bridge, collapsing the bridge. 

The conductor of The Solar Express says there's nothing to worry about. From his perspective, it will be the bridge itself that contracts to a 10th of its original size, and the train will be able to pass over it without issue. The conductor, being a persuasive man, is able to convince everyone to let him drive the train across the bridge to prove it.

The train hurls down the tracks at near light speed, its length becoming shorter and shorter until he reaches the bridge. What happens next? Who is right?

According to Einstein and the theory of relativity, they are both right. What we have here is Schrodinger's bridge, which is simultaneously collapsed and stable. 

It is not that the bridge or the train *appears* shorter due to speed, they are *actually* shorter, according to Einstein - in the same way that the wavelength of light must contract due to the motion of the emitter. 

And this is unworkable. It violates the law of identity. Things are no longer the way that they are. What we've essentially done here is broken all coherence, it may as well be a blue screen of death for the universe. 

There are countless similar thought experiments which show the unworkability of relativity theory. I have seen physicists flail trying to resolve them by coming up with bizarre, half-baked notions like *relativistic rigidity*, or other such reasons as to why reality can give us multiple versions of itself. This is simply kicking the intellectual can down the road. We will have to address the fact that when the features of existence for space itself become relative, we begin to lose coherence in the universe. What we're doing here is the equivalent of trying to force a square to be round.

### Light Under Newtonian Mechanics 
The fundamental conflict between relativity and Newtonian mechanics centers on what aspect of light changes in response to a change in the motion of the emitter. In relativity, the speed of light remains constant, but the wavelength (space itself) changes relative to the speed of the emitter. Under normal Newtonian mechanics, the wavelength would stay constant because space is treated as absolute - the frequency and the speed of light would change in response to the emitter's motion.

What makes this such a confusing subject is that all of these aspects of light are related to each other, and each paradigm could explain the behavior of light in their own way. But relativity makes more profound assumptions, that the universe itself responds to motion and adjusts accordingly.

Redshifting and blueshifting of light are explained by the frequency of light, not the wavelength. All color comes from the frequency of light. Newtonian mechanics could explain redshifting and blueshifting with equal validity to Einsteinian relativity. Under relativity, Einstein posits that a star moving towards us undergoes a relativistic Doppler shift where the wavelength contracts, which simultaneously increases the frequency of light and therefore causes a blue color. But under Newtonian mechanics, a star moving towards us would simply result in a faster speed of light from our perspective. 

## Part 2: History & Experiments

How did we get here?

This was the most painstaking part of researching this topic - tracing back the thought. Digging up 150 year old papers is not easy even in the information age.

Let's start with an experiment that changed the world, the Michelson-Morley experiment. 

### Michelson-Morley
For a long time, hundreds of years, a dominant theory in physics was the theory of the cosmic aether - the medium of space that allows light, and maybe even gravity to propagate in a vacuum. The Michelson-Morley experiment set out to prove the existence of the cosmic aether, but was unable to detect it. This result was considered a turning point in physics, where the cosmic aether hypothesis was largely abandoned. 

[The best video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbVwLRRl3o) I could find describing the details of the Michelson-Morley experiment was created by professor [John Howell in Jerusalem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dWILJsEAAAAJ&hl=en). I was quite surprised to see this comment from him in an exchange in the comments of his video, as I did not intentionally seek out someone who was critical of Relativity.

>I have constructed over 100 working interferometers during the past 20 years.  Each one of them has proven to me that the velocity of light is dependent on the velocity of the emitting source. 

You may be tempted to think this idea of an aether is silly, but many physicists even today hold sympathy with various forms of this idea. The existence of an aether could help explain many phenomenon that appears to be "spooky action at a distance." However, we have yet to make any measurement of such a material
