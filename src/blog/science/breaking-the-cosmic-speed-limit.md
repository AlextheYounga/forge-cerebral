# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

## Introduction
300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its origins. It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that builds the foundation for the vast majority of Einstein's relativity theory.

I am here to convince you that there is reason to doubt relativity - maybe not the whole of relativity, but just this single assumption: the constant velocity of light. 

This is bold claim, one that should make you immediately skeptical. If your immediate reaction to this is some form of shock, disgust, or any one of the stages of grief, I completely understand. When I first encountered this idea, from a very interesting person on the internet, I thought this was insanity. (I now regard this person as an extremely bright thinker, more on this later).

Indeed, to tug on this thread is liable to unravel a century of thought, but it does not condemn relativity entirely. Relativity is a vast collection of ideas, not all of which may be directly dependent on the speed of light. 

My goal is to break down one of the hardest subjects known to man into one of the simplest subjects. You'll find that one of the reasons relativity is so hard to understand is that much of it is in fact absurd while being presented as a matter of fact. 

I promise, you will leave this article being less confused than when you first clicked it. Even if you're a hardcore Einsteinian, I think you'll appreciate this; I'm fairly certain there are some thought experiments here you have not encountered before. It might take some time to unpack a century's worth of thought, but it will pay off.   

## Abstract
My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light is riddled with unresolvable logical paradoxes.
2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved, without a doubt, that light speed is fundamentally constant. It should still be considered an assumption.
3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian mechanics.


## Waves
The first bit of good news is that we don't have to concern ourselves here with whether or not light is a particle or a wave. The argument is the same regardless, and in either case, there is still a concept of *wavelength* and *frequency*. 

Imagine you are in a poorly-made toll booth which has no windows. You don't actually see the cars driving by, but every time a car drives by, a little box with a red light bleeps on your desk. This light is currently bleeping once every second. Given only this information, what can you say about the cars driving by? 

You can only say that a car drives by once a second, which is to say the frequency of cars is: one car per second. You have no other information, and no other information can be obtained. These cars could be driving by at 200 miles per hour, or they could be bumper to bumper, with only a few feet between each car. In other words, we have no concept of wavelength here. 

Many people assume that wavelength and frequency are essentially one of the same thing, but there are extremely important distinctions here. From wavelength we can extract measures of space and distance, but we cannot extract this information from the frequency. And as with our toll-booth example above, with frequency, we can extract information about quantities, but nothing about distance. 

But if we have both, **and only if we have both**, then we can measure speed. The speed of a wave is the frequency times the wavelength. 

The only way you can get around this is if you introduce a constant speed limit or upper speed limit. If we know that every incoming car contains a governor that maxes out at 80mph, then we have all the information we need. 80mph is 35m/s, and with a frequency of 1 car per second, we know for a fact there is 35 meters between each car. 

All of this is very important, because as you will see, we tend to measure light in a box. The information we can extract from light is very limited. When we measure light, we are nearly always measuring the frequency, as this information is generally easier to obtain and there are far more practical uses for this information.
