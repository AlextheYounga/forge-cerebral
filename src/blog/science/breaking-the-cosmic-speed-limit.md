# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

>*"We knew a million things we could hardly understand."*

### Introduction
300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its origins or even how to defend it. 

But even Einstein himself struggled to defend this point, and those who studied his life [claim he wrestled with this idea *to the point of despair.*](https://history.aip.org/exhibits/einstein/essay-einstein-relativity.htm) The idea was not truly of Einstein's making, but borrowed from the works of Lorentz and Maxwell. All three of these men had a common problem. They were all scrambling to maintain a theory they had spent their lives defending, the luminiferous cosmic aether, and this theory had just been proven unlikely.

It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that builds the foundation of all relativity theory, and it is this postulate that has made much of modern theoretical physics unintelligible and unworkable. To pull on this thread is liable to unravel nearly a century of thought.

In my research on this topic, I have been constantly reminded of the force that drives the vast majority of people to the beliefs they hold: social status. Einstein was a super-star of his time and his fame made relativity a high-status belief. To question its validity is inherently low-status, and few accomplished physicists take the risk - despite knowing full-well the unworkability of its assumptions. But there are accomplished physicists who buck the trend, and I will include them here. 

The assumption of the constant velocity of light requires additional assumptions, like time dilation and length contraction, in order to remain logically valid. But these theories bring an even greater number of paradoxes which again require additional theories to resolve. This is a sign that we are barking up the wrong tree and must reexamine our underlying assumptions. And when we do that, what we find is that light probably isn't as special as we might think. 

## Abstract
My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light postulate is riddled with unresolvable logical paradoxes.
2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved that light speed is fundamentally constant.
3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian mechanics.


## What Relativity Is And Isn't
It is not true to say that Relativity overturned the Newtonian physics. Physics is, as a rule, Newtonian, and only in a few special cases do we decide to diverge from his principles.

Relativity is largely an extension of Newtonian mechanics. Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, (E = mc2), is nothing that Newton would have disagreed with. Though Newton did not pursue this particular problem with the same vigor as Einstein, Newton speculated that mass and energy were likely equivalent.

In 1704 Sir Isaac Newton wrote in his revolutionary book “Opticks”:

>"Do not Bodies and Light act mutually upon one another that is to say, Bodies upon Light in emitting, reflecting, refracting and inflecting it, and Light upon Bodies for heating them, and putting their parts into a vibrating motion wherein heat consists?" 
>"Gross bodies and light are convertible into one another..."

There are many aspects of Relativity that people seem to think conflict with Newtonian mechanics, such as gravitational lensing, redshifting and blueshifting of light, and black holes. All of which can be explained within the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics, even if Newton's original measurements were somewhat incorrect. 




## Part 1: The Logic

> Light has a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

The mainstream scientific perspective states confidently that light is constant in all inertial reference frames, which is to say that it does not matter how fast the source of the light is moving - it will remain constant.

An example of an inertial reference frame is driving down a flat desert road and setting your cruise control at 50mph. In this frame the driver is undergoing no acceleration. Assuming the car has Cadillac suspension, the only way the driver can discern that he is actually moving is by witnessing the tumbleweeds go by. Indeed, if your vehicle was large enough you could even play ping pong without issue. On earth we never feel as though we are moving because any acceleration we experience is so gradual that we can hardly detect it.

Okay, so now let us examine this idea of a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

If we fire a 9mm handgun from a stationary position, we will record a speed of about 850mph. Now imagine firing the same handgun out the front of your vehicle moving at 50mph. From your perspective in the driver seat, you will also record a velocity of 850mph. However, our man in the stationary position will record a velocity of 900mph.

This is intuitive. An object's velocity cannot be logically dissociated from the speed of its source - we can't simply disregard the car. The speed of the source would then be v = v1 + v2, meaning the total speed would be equal to the velocity of the bullet, plus the velocity of the emitter. This is the simple, intuitive Newtonian physics of the everyday world around us.

But Einstein claims that light does not behave this way. The speed of the bullet would be equal to 850mph in both instances, he claims. It wouldn't even matter if the car was driving at 850mph. Both the driver would record a speed of 850mph, and the person standing still would also record a speed of 850mph.

How can this be? Well, it can't - not by itself. Even Einstein will tell you that this assertion by itself makes no logical sense whatsoever. 

Here is Einstein himself explaining this very problem by imagining what would happen if we were to measure a light beam moving in the same direction as a moving carriage.

RELATIVITY THE SPECIAL AND GENERAL THEORY (pg 23)\
    -ALBERT EINSTEIN

There is no debate that this notion, on its own, is logically invalid. The only way any of this becomes workable is by adding two new ideas: length contraction and time dilation. 

### Length Contraction
The best way that I have heard to explain the real consequences of length contraction is by imagining you are at the beach. First, let's talk about what a normal day at a very familiar Newtonian beach looks like, where all the physics makes sense, and then we will envision a beach that satisfies Einstein.

We will do just a little bit of math, but it is very simple math, no need to worry. If you're familiar with basic physics, this might be worth skipping over, but I should warn you that things will get weird here very soon, and it may be worth reviewing the basics.

#### A Day at the Newtonian Beach
Imagine you are standing on the shore of an ocean.

You see the waves coming towards you, a new wave crashing every second. We’ll say this is the frequency of the ocean, 1 wave per second. The symbol for frequency is ( ƒ ), so this would be 1ƒ.

Between each wave is about **2 meters**, so the wavelength (with the symbol λ) will be 2, or 2λ. From here, we have all we need to obtain the speed of the ocean waves. 

>**The speed of the wave is equal to frequency × wavelength. (ƒλ)**

So then, 1ƒ × 2λ = 2 m/s. Our waves are traveling at a speed of 2 m/s.

Now imagine that you begin to walk towards the ocean. 

We enter the water and continue walking forward directly into the oncoming waves. As you’re walking forward, you turn your head to the side and see the waves pass you by.

From your perspective, the waves are now passing by at an increased frequency. Before, we saw only 1 wave crash per second, but now we’re watching 2 crests of a wave pass by us every second.

So now, in relation to our moving position, it would appear from our perspective as if the waves are moving at a speed of 2ƒ × 2λ = 4 m/s. Again, the waves are still moving at 2 m/s in relation to the beach, but from our now moving perspective, they now appear to be moving faster. This is a crucial point we will visit later.

Now, knowing this, we could also calculate our own current speed by simply subtracting the apparent speed of the waves from the speed we originally measured while stationary. The waves now appear to be moving at 4 m/s, but when we were stationary, they were traveling at 2/ms. So, v1 - v2, our walking speed must be 2 m/s.

Hopefully this makes perfect sense so far; this is exactly the kind of thing we experience when we go to the beach. And our movement in relation to other moving objects seriously effects our ability to measure any given thing.

But this is not how Einstein claimed light works.

#### A Beach to Satisfy Einstein
We’re now at a different beach, an Einsteinian beach.

We’re stationary on the shore of the Einsteinian beach. We see that the waves crash at a frequency of 1 wave per second, and the waves here are about 2 meters long each, the same as our last beach. So the speed of the waves are 2 m/s.

**But this time, this speed is constant. The waves will always travel at 2 m/s.**

Now we decide to walk towards the beach, and here is where everything becomes surreal.

Suddenly, right before our eyes, the entire landscape of the ocean changes.

Every wave now contracts to 1 meter in length in order to maintain our original speed of 2 m/s.

It is not a perception issue either, the ocean is now physically different. The distance between each wave is now larger. Space itself has contracted in response to our movement forward.

Remember, the speed of a wave is ƒ * λ. This is how the math behind relativity works. If we simply adjust the wavelength value in response to any change in the frequency that we would see as a result of the motion of an observer, we will always retain a constant velocity of our wave. 

Within the framework of relativity, space itself must change in response to increases in speed. On the flip-side, objects themselves will also experience this length contraction due to increase in speed. Keep in mind that these changes can only become noticeable when these objects are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but for our thought experiment, let's exaggerate the speed requirements simply to analyze the logical conundrums we will encounter at greater speeds. 

Now, as we're walking into the ocean, let's imagine there is another person standing on the Einsteinian beach who is watching us. What do they see? Will they see the ocean contract in response to our movement?

No, according to relativity, they will watch us become thinner. The observer on the beach will not be able to agree with our measurements of the ocean as we are moving towards it. We will see a contracted ocean, while the observer will see a contracted man. This result is due to assumption that the speed of light must remain constant, and one of the theories created by Henrick Lorentz, what is known as the "Lorentz Transformation". 

So, to recap, from this thought experiment we can gather that, based on our velocity, the universe seems to present us alternative versions of reality. On our Einsteinian beach, the ocean itself contracts in response to our movement towards it, and this is not simply the appearance of the ocean contracting - space itself has actually changed. And for the stationary observer watching us, they will see no such change in the ocean, but a change only in the length of the moving object or observer. 

Just in case there is any confusion left about the mainstream positions of relativity, here is one more short thought experiment.

Imagine a square room, 50 feet by 50 feet in area, containing two people. One of these people is The Flash, who can sprint at speeds approaching the speed of light. The other person is someone with a slow motion camera capable of capturing The Flash while at high speed. 

The Flash proceeds to run near the speed of light to the opposite side of the room. The Flash is able to reach speeds resulting in a Lorentz transformation factor of 10, meaning that in the eyes of the FLash, the opposite side of the room is now only 5 feet ahead of him. From the perspective of the cameraman, The Flash, the man himself, is now only a sliver of himself, thinned to a horrific 1/10 of his original width. 

From these two perspectives, neither man can agree as to the objective size of the room, as length is no longer an objective property of the universe. 

### A Quick Note on Logic
In logic, there is a very important rule, arguably the most important rule of all, called “the law of identity.” This rule is very simple. 

>Things are the way that they are, and they are not the way they are not.

If something defies this rule, we can be certain it is wrong. This has nothing to do with man's reasoning ability or argumentation, but coherence of the universe itself. In the absence of this rule, existence becomes unworkable. For instance, how could something even exist if it could not exist at the same time? Simple, this is a true metaphysical impossibility, meaning it could never be the case in any possible form of existence. 

Logic is a property of existence. If something exists, it has features of existence, and those features have properties. Those properties are what we call logic. For instance, an object exists, and it has the features of 4 equal sides. One of the properties of having 4 equal sides is that it can never have the feature of roundness. That's logic. My thinking had nothing to do with it, it is true regardless of my rational thought about this objective property of existence. It doesn't matter what universe you place this object, if it has 4 equal sides, it will never have the features of roundness.

This is what Schrodinger was trying to explain to the Copenhagen physicists with his famous cat thought experiment, but the point went over their heads. Many of them still don't really understand it. They ironically parade the idea around like a talking point for the complexity of the universe. You'd have to go to college to be that confused.

It's not complex. It's perhaps the simplest thing imaginable, the most irreducible property of existence. Something cannot be a thing and its opposite. A cat cannot be alive and dead. He was trying to tell them they were wrong, and they were wrong.  Thankfully the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics has now started to fall out of favor due to its many logical conundrums. 

So when I now present this exact problem to relativity, we can know for certain that the theory is unworkable. 

### The Consequences of Relative Space
Imagine a train must occasionally pass over a bridge. This bridge is 1/10 the length of the train. The engineers never considered making the bridge strong enough to support more than 1/10 section of train at a time, as 1/10 of a train is all that could ever fit on the bridge at any given moment. 

But time has passed and there has been a major breakthrough. Someone has invented a train that can travel at near light speed, and they've appropriately named it The Solar Express. 

The Solar Express can achieve speeds so great that it experiences a Lorentz transformation factor of 10, meaning it will contract to 1/10 of its original size as it reaches this speed. 

An engineer points out that this is a serious problem, as the bridge it will have to pass over can only support 1/10 of the bridge. From the engineer's perspective, standing stationary watching the bridge, the entire train will indeed be able to fit onto the bridge, collapsing the bridge. 

The conductor of The Solar Express says there's nothing to worry about. From his perspective, it will be the bridge itself that contracts to a 10th of its original size, and the train will be able to pass over it without issue. The conductor, being a persuasive man, is able to convince everyone to let him drive the train across the bridge to prove it.

The train hurls down the tracks at near light speed, its length becoming shorter and shorter until he reaches the bridge. What happens next? Who is right?

According to Einstein and the theory of relativity, they are both right. What we have here is Schrodinger's bridge, which is simultaneously collapsed and stable. 

It is not that the bridge or the train *appears* shorter due to speed, they are *actually* shorter, according to Einstein - in the same way that the wavelength of light must contract due to the motion of the emitter. 

And this is unworkable. It violates the law of identity. Things are no longer the way that they are. What we've essentially done here is broken all coherence, it may as well be a blue screen of death for the universe. 

There are countless similar thought experiments which show the unworkability of relativity theory. I have seen physicists flail trying to resolve them by coming up with bizarre, half-baked notions like *relativistic rigidity*, or other such reasons as to why reality can give us multiple versions of itself. This is simply kicking the intellectual can down the road. We will have to address the fact that when the features of existence for space itself become relative, we begin to lose coherence in the universe. What we're doing here is the equivalent of trying to force a square to be round.

### Light Under Newtonian Mechanics 
The fundamental conflict between relativity and Newtonian mechanics centers on what aspect of light changes in response to a change in the motion of the emitter. In relativity, the speed of light remains constant, but the wavelength (space itself) changes relative to the speed of the emitter. Under normal Newtonian mechanics, the wavelength would stay constant because space is treated as absolute - the frequency and the speed of light would change in response to the emitter's motion.

What makes this such a confusing subject is that all of these aspects of light are related to each other, and each paradigm could explain the behavior of light in their own way. But relativity makes more profound assumptions, that the universe itself responds to motion and adjusts accordingly.

Redshifting and blueshifting of light are explained by the frequency of light, not the wavelength. All color comes from the frequency of light. Newtonian mechanics could explain redshifting and blueshifting with equal validity to Einsteinian relativity. Under relativity, Einstein posits that a star moving towards us undergoes a relativistic Doppler shift where the wavelength contracts, which simultaneously increases the frequency of light and therefore causes a blue color. But under Newtonian mechanics, a star moving towards us would simply result in a faster speed of light from our perspective. 

## Part 2: History & Experiments

How did we get here?

This was the most painstaking part of researching this topic - tracing back the thought. Digging up 150 year old papers is not easy even in the information age.

Let's start with an experiment that changed the world, the Michelson-Morley experiment. 

### Michelson-Morley
For a long time, hundreds of years, a dominant theory in physics was the theory of the cosmic aether - the medium of space that allows light, and maybe even gravity to propagate in a vacuum. The Michelson-Morley experiment set out to prove the existence of the cosmic aether, but was unable to detect it. This result was considered a turning point in physics, where the cosmic aether hypothesis was largely abandoned. 

[The best video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbVwLRRl3o) I could find describing the details of the Michelson-Morley experiment was created by professor [John Howell in Jerusalem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dWILJsEAAAAJ&hl=en). I was quite surprised to see this comment from him in an exchange in the comments of his video, as I did not intentionally seek out someone who was critical of Relativity.

>I have constructed over 100 working interferometers during the past 20 years.  Each one of them has proven to me that the velocity of light is dependent on the velocity of the emitting source. 

You may be tempted to think this idea of an aether is silly, but many physicists even today hold sympathy with various forms of this idea. The existence of an aether could help explain many phenomenon that appears to be "spooky action at a distance." However, we have yet to make any measurement of such a material
