# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

>*"We knew a million things we could hardly understand."*

### Introduction
300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its origins and everyone has forgotten how to defend it. 

But even Einstein himself struggled to defend this point, and those who studied his life claim he wrestled with this idea *to the point of despair.*

It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that has made much of modern theoretical physics unintelligible and unworkable. To pull on this thread is liable to unravel decades of thought, so I must proceed with care.

On its own the postulate is logically incoherent, and requires additional theories like time dilation and length contraction in order to remain logically valid. But these theories bring an even greater number of paradoxes which again require additional theories to resolve. 

This is a sign that we are barking up the wrong tree and must reexamine our underlying assumptions. And when we do that, what we find is that light probably isn't as special as we might think. 

## Abstract
My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light postulate is riddled with logical paradoxes.
2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved that light speed is fundamentally constant.
3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian mechanics.


## The Problems of Constant Velocity

> Light has a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

The above is the mainstream relativistic perspective of light. By "all inertial reference frames", what is really being said is: light has a constant velocity regardless of whether its source is moving. 

A quick recap of Newtonian mechanics is necessary.

Imagine you are driving a car at 50mph, and you were able to maintain that speed of 50mph. This is an inertial reference frame. Since you are not undergoing any acceleration (the act of increasing speed), it is indistinguishable from standing still. 

If your vehicle was large enough you could play ping pong without any issue. 

A person standing still fires a 9mm handgun and measures the velocity of the bullet at 850mph. You fire the same handgun while driving your car at 50mph. If you measured the speed of the bullet inside your vehicle, you would record a speed of 850mph. This is the speed relative to you, from your perspective. 

From the perspective of the person standing still, your bullet being fired from a moving vehicle would reach 900mph. 

This is intuitive. The speed of the source would then be v + v, meaning the total speed would be equal to the velocity of the bullet, plus the velocity of the emitter. 

But Einstein claims that light does not behave this way. The speed of the bullet would be equal to 850mph in both instances. It wouldn't even matter if the car was driving at 850mph. Both the driver would record a speed of 850mph, and the person standing still would also record a speed of 850mph. 

An object's velocity cannot be logically dissociated from the speed source, or in physics what is called "the emitter". 

There is no debate that this notion, on its own, is logically invalid. The only way any of this becomes workable is by adding two new ideas: length contraction and time dilation.
