# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

>*"We knew a million things we could hardly understand."*

### Introduction
300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its origins and everyone has forgotten how to defend it. 

But even Einstein himself struggled to defend this point, and those who studied his life claim he wrestled with this idea *to the point of despair.*

It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that has made much of modern theoretical physics unintelligible and unworkable. It is this postulate that builds the foundation of all relativity theory

To pull on this thread is liable to unravel decades of thought, so I must proceed with care.

On its own the postulate is logically incoherent, and requires additional theories like time dilation and length contraction in order to remain logically valid. But these theories bring an even greater number of paradoxes which again require additional theories to resolve. 

This is a sign that we are barking up the wrong tree and must reexamine our underlying assumptions. And when we do that, what we find is that light probably isn't as special as we might think. 

## Abstract
My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light postulate is riddled with logical paradoxes.
2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved that light speed is fundamentally constant.
3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian mechanics.


## The Problems of Constant Velocity

> Light has a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

The mainstream scientific perspective states confidently that light is constant in all inertial reference frames, which is to say that it does not matter how fast the source of the light is moving - it will remain constant.

An example of an inertial reference frame is driving down a flat desert road and setting your cruise control at 50mph. In this frame the driver is undergoing no acceleration. Assuming the car has Cadillac suspension, the only way the driver can discern that he is actually moving is by witnessing the tumbleweeds go by. Indeed, if your vehicle was large enough you could even play ping pong without issue. On earth we never feel as though we are moving because any acceleration we experience is so gradual that we can hardly detect it.

Okay, so now let us examine this idea of a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.

If we fire a 9mm handgun from a stationary position, we will record a speed of about 850mph. Now imagine firing the same handgun out the front of your vehicle moving at 50mph. From your perspective in the driver seat, you will also record a velocity of 850mph. However, our man in the stationary position will record a velocity of 900mph.

This is intuitive. An object's velocity cannot be logically dissociated from the speed of its source - we can't simply disregard the car. The speed of the source would then be v = v1 + v2, meaning the total speed would be equal to the velocity of the bullet, plus the velocity of the emitter. This is the simple, intuitive Newtonian physics of the everyday world around us.

But Einstein claims that light does not behave this way. The speed of the bullet would be equal to 850mph in both instances, he claims. It wouldn't even matter if the car was driving at 850mph. Both the driver would record a speed of 850mph, and the person standing still would also record a speed of 850mph.

How can this be? Well, it can't - not by itself. Even Einstein will tell you that this assertion by itself makes no logical sense whatsoever. 

There is no debate that this notion, on its own, is logically invalid. The only way any of this becomes workable is by adding two new ideas: length contraction and time dilation. 

Here is Einstien himself explaining this very problem by imagining what would happen if we were to measure a light beam moving in the same direction as a moving carriage.

## Length Contraction
The best way that I have heard to explain length contraction is by imagining you are at the beach. First, let's talk about what a normal day at a very familiar Newtonian beach looks like, where all the physics makes sense, and then we will envision a beach that satisfies Einstein.

We will do just a little bit of math, but it is very simple math, no need to worry. If you're familiar with basic physics, this might be worth skipping over, but I should warn you that things will get weird here very soon, and it may be worth reviewing the basics.

### A Day at the Beach
Imagine you are standing on the shore of an ocean.

You see the waves coming towards you, a new wave crashing every second. We’ll say this is the frequency of the ocean, 1 wave per second. The symbol for frequency is ( ƒ ), so this would be 1ƒ.

Between each wave is about **2 meters**, so the wavelength (with the symbol λ) will be 2, or 2λ. From here, we have all we need to obtain the speed of the ocean waves. 

>**The speed of the wave is equal to frequency × wavelength. (ƒλ)**

So then, 1ƒ × 2λ = 2 m/s. Our waves are traveling at a speed of 2 m/s.

Now imagine that you begin to walk towards the ocean. 

We enter the water and continue walking forward directly into the oncoming waves. As you’re walking forward, you turn your head to the side and see the waves pass you by.

From your perspective, the waves are now passing by at an increased frequency. Before, we saw only 1 wave crash per second, but now we’re watching 2 crests of a wave pass by us every second.

So now, in relation to our moving position, it would appear from our perspective as if the waves are moving at a speed of 2ƒ × 2λ = 4 m/s. Again, the waves are still moving at 2 m/s in relation to the beach, but from our now moving perspective, they now appear to be moving faster. This is a crucial point we will visit later.

Now, knowing this, we could also calculate our own current speed by simply subtracting the apparent speed of the waves from the speed we originally measured while stationary. The waves now appear to be moving at 4 m/s, but when we were stationary, they were traveling at 2/ms. So, v1 - v2, our walking speed must be 2 m/s.

Hopefully this makes perfect sense so far; this is exactly the kind of thing we experience when we go to the beach. And our movement in relation to other moving objects seriously effects our ability to measure any given thing.

But this is not how Einstein claimed light works.

### A Beach to Satisfy Einstein
We’re now at a different beach, an Einsteinian beach, where everything is, as Einstein would say, "so natural and simple", (yeah, right). 

We will imagine that the ocean behaves in the same way that Einstein claims light behaves.

We’re stationary on the shore of the Einsteinian beach, just taking in the sun. We see that the waves crash at a frequency of 1 wave per second, and the waves here are about 2 meters long each. So the speed of the waves are 2 m/s - the same as our last beach.

**But this time, this speed is constant. The waves will always travel at 2 m/s.**

Now we decide to walk towards the beach, and here is where everything becomes surreal.

Suddenly, right before our eyes, the entire landscape of the ocean changes.

Every wave now contracts to 1 meter in length in order to maintain our original speed of 2 m/s.

It is not a perception issue either, the ocean is now physically different. The distance between each wave is now larger. Space itself has contracted in response to our movement forward.

Remember, the speed of a wave is ƒ * λ. This is how the math behind relativity works. If we simply adjust the wavelength value in response to any change in the frequency that we would see as a result of the motion of an observer, we will always retain a constant velocity of our wave. Einstein says that space itself changes in response to increases in speed. 

According to Einstein, all objects will experience this phenomenon when moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. But as we will soon see, this introduces some serious problems. 

Now, as we're walking into the ocean, let's imagine there is another person standing on the Einstieian beach who is watching us. What do they see? Will they see the ocean contract in front of our eyes?

No, according to Einstein's principles, they will watch us become thinner.
