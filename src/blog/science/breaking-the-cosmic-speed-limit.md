# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

>*"We knew a million things we could hardly understand."*

### Introduction
300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its origins and everyone has forgotten how to defend it. 

But even Einstein himself struggled to defend this point, and those who studied his life claim he wrestled with this idea *to the point of despair.*

It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that has made much of modern theoretical physics unintelligible and unworkable. To pull on this thread is liable to unravel decades of thought, so I must proceed with care.

On its own the postulate is logically incoherent, and requires additional theories like time dilation and length contraction in order to remain logically valid. But these theories bring an even greater number of paradoxes which again require additional theories to resolve. 

This is a sign that we are barking up the wrong tree and must reexamine our underlying assumptions. And when we do that, what we find is that light probably isn't as special as we might think. 

## Abstract
My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light postulate is riddled with logical paradoxes.
2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved that light speed is fundamentally constant.
3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian mechanics.


## The First Problem

**The Mainstream Claim:**

> Light has a constant velocity in all inertial reference frames.
