# Breaking the Cosmic Speed Limit
**A New Hope for FTL**

## Introduction
300,000 kilometers per second. The constant velocity of light.

This is the number constantly ogled at us by every angle of modern science. It has been repeated for so long that most have forgotten its origins. It is this singular assumption, the constant velocity of light, that builds the foundation for the vast majority of Einstein's relativity theory.

I am here to convince you that there is reason to doubt relativity - maybe not the whole of relativity, but just this single assumption: the constant velocity of light. 

This is bold claim, one that should make you immediately skeptical. If your immediate reaction to this is some form of shock, disgust, or any one of the stages of grief, I completely understand. When I first encountered this idea, from a very interesting person on the internet, I thought this was insanity. (I now regard this person as an extremely bright thinker, more on this later).

Indeed, to tug on this thread is liable to unravel a century of thought, but it does not condemn relativity entirely. Relativity is a vast collection of ideas, not all of which may be directly dependent on the speed of light. 

My goal is to break down one of the hardest subjects known to man into one of the simplest subjects. You'll find that one of the reasons relativity is so hard to understand is that much of it is in fact absurd while being presented as a matter of fact. 

I promise, you will leave this article being less confused than when you first clicked it. Even if you're a hardcore Einsteinian, I think you'll appreciate this; I'm fairly certain there are some thought experiments here you have not encountered before. It might take some time to unpack a century's worth of thought, but it will pay off.   

## Abstract
My research has brought me to the following conclusions:

1.  The constant velocity of light is riddled with unresolvable logical paradoxes.
2.  There is no experiment which has ever proved, without a doubt, that light speed is fundamentally constant. It should still be considered an assumption.
3.  The behavior of light can be largely explained using Newtonian mechanics.


## Waves
Before we can really dive deep into this, the reader must be familiar with some of the properties of waves, and we may need to dispel some simple confusions surrounding wavelength and frequency.

### Measuring waves
The first bit of good news is that we don't have to concern ourselves here with whether or not light is a particle or a wave. The argument is the same regardless. In either case, there is still a concept of *wavelength* and *frequency*. 

Imagine you are in a poorly-made toll booth which has no windows. You don't actually see the cars driving by, but every time a car drives by, a little box with a red light bleeps on your desk. This light is currently bleeping once every second. Given only this information, what can you say about the cars driving by? 

You can only say that a car drives by once a second, which is to say the frequency of cars is: one car per second. You have no other information, and no other information can be obtained. These cars could be driving by at 200 miles per hour, or they could be bumper to bumper, with only a few feet between each car. In other words, we have no concept of wavelength here. 

Many people claim that wavelength and frequency are essentially one of the same thing, but there are extremely important distinctions here. From wavelength we can extract measures of space and distance, but we cannot extract this information from the frequency. And as with our toll-booth example above, with frequency, we can extract information about quantities, but nothing about distance. 

But if we have both, **and only if we have both**, then we can measure speed. The speed of a wave is the frequency times the wavelength. 

A common point of confusion comes from those who have studied physics at the surface level. They will say, "wavelength and frequency are inverses of each other" as a blanket statement. This is not true as a general rule, for the reasons I've stated above. Given only one of these variables, you cannot calculate the other. 

The confusion stems from what they've been taught about light. The wavelength and frequency can only be inverses if we introduce a constant speed or an upper speed limit. Of all the things in the universe, the only thing we give a constant speed is light, which should be a red flag in itself. 

Going back to our toll booth example, if we know that every incoming car contains a governor that maxes out at 80mph, and we assume all cars are traveling at this maximum speed, then we have all the information we need. 80mph is 35m/s, and with a frequency of 1 car per second, we know for a fact there is 35 meters between each car. 

Our toll booth example is important, because as you will see, we tend to measure light in a box. 

The information we can extract from light is very limited. When we measure light, we are nearly always measuring the frequency, as this information is always easier to obtain and has far more practical use-cases. To measure wavelength, we have to redirect light in clever ways and then try to get an accurate measure of distances between two points. To measure frequency, the problem is much simpler, just start counting up, like counting the number of times the red light bleeps in the toll booth.

### Color
Your first instinct might be to ask, well what about color? Is this not how we measure the wavelength of light? 

Color is better thought of as a measure of the energy levels of light. Light can have less or more energy, (which shouldn't really be possible with a constant speed limit, but more on this later), and we primarily measure the energy levels of light using the frequency. If you've ever watched the show Chernobyl, you may have heard them speak of *Cherenkov radiation*, which is a fascinating phenomenon. Cherenkov radiation is theorized to be the speed of light traveling faster than its supposed to inside of a given medium, creating a kind of sonic boom. The tremendous energy released gives off a fantastic blue color. 

## The Doppler Effect
The phenomenon you will hear repeated most throughout this argument is variations of The Doppler Effect, sometimes referred to as *"Doppler shift"*, or when discussed under the paradigm of relativity, *"relativistic Doppler shift"*, since normal principles of the Doppler Effect do not apply to relativity in the same way. An understanding of this simple phenomenon in its entirety is a requirement. 

The Doppler Effect is very simple. At its core, the principle is simply that speeds are added together. If you throw a ball while running, it will move faster than a ball thrown from a stationary position. A bullet fired from a moving vehicle travels faster than a bullet fired from a fixed position. And a sound wave emitted from an accelerating plane might travel faster than the sound wave directly in front of it, (a sonic boom).


Speaking of sonic booms, before being able to grasp the problems of a constant velocity of light, the reader must fully understand the concept of the Doppler Effect, which is fairly straightforward.

The Doppler Effect is fundamentally very simple. 

In short, speeds are always added together. A 9mm bullet travels at 850mph. A bullet fired from a vehicle moving 50mph will travel at 900mph. We apply this concept to everything in the known universe *except for light.
