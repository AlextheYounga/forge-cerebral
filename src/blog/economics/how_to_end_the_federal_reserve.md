# How to End the Fed
![End the Fed](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRcq71xOcH2gAW_ZB-OnbzSiVtTG2Lu-Xb22bROIHeo6ksayWhB_qmlfhtHUbmSae9_Kw&usqp=CAU)

There are gigabytes of text which detail why we should end the Federal Reserve, and given the recent outcry for an investigation into the Federal Reserve, those words have clearly been seen by the masses. Hopefully that investigation leads to the eventual ending of the Federal Reserve.

But very little has been written about how to end the Federal Reserve, and that is what I wish to address here.

The Federal Reserve is a magic temple where modern alchemists transmute paper into poverty. This is a machine which should be considered a weapon of mass-destruction and treated with the same reverence and security as we do our nuclear arsenal. It should only be unearthed if we are forced by an aggressor to threaten the impoverishment of everyone as a M.A.D. deterrent.

Here is John Maynard Keynes, quoting Lenin, and explaining in eloquent detail how inflation destroys societies:
![Keynes Quoting Lenin on Inflation](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F513b38e3-ea3e-406a-a392-409318af4dfe_688x536.png)

Inflation is always harmful; it depreciates the value of the currency, raises everybody’s cost of living, imposes what is, in effect, a tax on the poorest, wipes out the value of savings, discourages future savings, redistributes wealth and income wantonly, and encourages/rewards speculation and gambling at the expense of thrift and work.

The ending of the Federal Reserve is much easier said than done, which is why so little has been written on this topic.

Only an insane person like myself, who has ruminated on this fantasy for years, could sink thousands of hours into studying this manmade horror so that it is no longer beyond my comprehension.

I don’t expect the average reader here to fully digest everything written here, but I have done my best to break down the problem simply. This post goes out, first and foremost, to other insane people like myself.

This is not a trivial problem, and I expect I have made many shortsighted errors in my reasoning here. I want to be called out for those errors; I want this to serve as a starting template for a future plan. I would love as many minds as possible to come together and finally end this monstrosity before it destroys our naton.

## The Problem with Inflation
**The simple fact of the matter is that there is no possible way to reverse inflation.** Any further manipulation to the money supply only acts to twist the knife. What makes an object "sound money" is its ability to remain stable across time. Both appreciation and depreciation generally act against the usability of money. 

There are two cases where one may check their bank account and proceed to find the nearest high-rise window to leap out of: if they discover that the purchasing power of their savings has suddenly halved, or in the opposite case of appreciation, that the value of their debt burden has suddenly doubled in value. This latter example is precisely why there are little to no long-term debt contracts in Bitcoin, because the value fluctuates to wildly to facilitate this. 

A perfectly stable money is likely impossible, or at least, I have never heard a good argument on how to create a truly fixed dollar.

A *slight* appreciation of money is preferable to depreciation, as this will increase the purchasing power of all money, incentivize saving, disincentivize the accumulation of debt, and incentivize a speedy repayment of all current debts. It puts pressure on the right incentives for economic prosperity and prudent human behavior.

You may read through my plan to end the Federal Reserve below and disagree with me on the details. 
**But we must agree on this point:**

> The key objective in ending the Federal Reserve is to minimize any fluctuations in the current money supply as best we can. 

This too will be impossible. We will unfortunately have to manipulate the money supply further in our efforts to end the Fed. But I think there is a way to do this in such a delicate manner as to go unnoticed by most.

## The Plan
1. **Revoke all Federal Reserve monetary policy privileges**
    The Federal Reserve should no longer have the ability to directly manipulate the money supply.

2. **Lock down all debt assets on the Federal Reserve balance sheet**
    Here I am referring to all the assets on the balance sheet which have a contractural expiration, (e.g. US Treasuries, Mortgage-backed Securities and other loan types). This accounts for the vast majority of the assets on the balance sheet, roughly 99%. These assets should be forced to expire and naturally roll off the balance sheet over a period of 30 years, (the longest UST and MBS expiration date). These assets should not be sold for the remainder of their contractural lifespan.

3. **Any assets on the balance sheet which do not have an expiration date should be slowly sold off to the market over a span of 1-5 years**
    I cannot get a good estimation as to how much of this asset type exists on the Fed’s balance sheet. I suspect this number is possibly less than a billion, and is therefore inconsequential. If anyone has this number, I would greatly appreciate it.

4. **The Federal Reserve is transformed into a completely private institution, which has no special legal banking privileges**
    The Federal Reserve's only privileges become its current position in the market, its role in bank-to-bank lending, the remaining interest payments on its assets, and its history. This is far more than it deserves, but our primary goal must be the avoidance of economic disaster.

5. **If the Federal Reserve cannot function as a private bank...**
    Which is likely, then the big banks will need to eventually sort out amongst themselves how they are going to facilitate bank-to-bank lending, designate who may act as the bank for banks, and assign central banking services to other private institutions within the confines of private banking law. The banks also may decide that the Federal Reserve is no longer necessary and abandon it to slowly die completely, and this too would be perfectly acceptable.

## The Balance Sheet Details
As of this writing, the Federal Reserve has $6.8T on its balance sheet. This comes after a stark 25% reduction in its balance sheet from $8.9T over the past 2 years, a difference of $2.1T. This means that the Fed printed $8.9T and bought assets on the open market using this printed money. 

So what have they been buying? Mostly US debt. This ourobourus of a system has allowed the US Federal Government to always have a ready-buyer of new US debt. The Federal reserve owns approximately 5T of the national debt, and also artificially drives up domestic demand for debt. To end the Federal Reserve is to drastically limit how much new US debt can be created.

![Fed Balance Sheet Composition](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GjdTGMMWsAEj-VO?format=jpg&name=medium)

About $4.2T of assets on the balance sheet are US Treasury bonds (USTs), [(source)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TREAST). About $2.2T of assets on the balance sheet are Mortgage-backed securities (MBS), [(source)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WSHOMCB). This in total makes up $6.4T of the balance sheet, about 94%. The remaining 6% is a mixed bag of various other debt securities including corporate debt, federal agency debt, and other loan types which also have a contractural expiration date. 

The composition of expirations for USTs on the balance sheet are the following:

| Expiration | Value   |
|------------|---------|
| 15D        | $0.09T  |
| 16-90D     | $0.18T  |
| 90D-1Y     | $0.44T  |
| 1-5Y       | $1.45T  |
| 5-10Y      | $0.575T |
| 10Y+       | $1.54T  |

The composition of expirations for MBS is a lot more straightforward, as the vast majority of mortgages are 30Y mortgages.

| Expiration | Value    |
|------------|----------|
| 1-5Y       | $0.0039T |
| 5-10Y      | $0.035T  |
| 10Y+       | $2.1T    |


## Natural Expiration of Debt Assets
Let's consider what might happen if we prevented all debt assets on the balance sheet from being sold and allowed them to expire naturally. Here is a projection of the balance sheet over the next 30 years under this arrangement:

![Projection of Assets Naturally Expiring on Fed Balance Sheet](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GjiURSdXMAEYu-T?format=jpg&name=medium)
The code for this chart can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/AlextheYounga/504918bdb45c80e7c2bac4ce1b65a4d3).

One potential issue is that the composition of debt expirations are front-loaded so that you would see an initial sharp decline that leveled off with time. You would see a big 10% drop in the first year that would level off to a 1.7% drop per year over time. The average decline would be about 3.1%. I am assuming the Fed has done some due diligence to buy an equal distribution of expiration dates across each expiration group, which may be assuming too much.

## Not Quantitative Tightening
The benefit of this approach is that this is not really the same as quantitative tightening. No funds will be removed from the bank's reserves. The bank reserves will remain at the current level under this arrangement.

**To fully explain this, a crash course in quantitative tightening is probably necessary:**

Admittedly, there is a genius to the way Fed monetary policy works. Whenever the Fed "tightens", they are selling assets off their balance sheet to "primary dealers" (big banks) on the open market. The Federal Reserve acts as a "bank for big banks". All the major US banks store their reserves at the Fed like a savings account, and they even receive interest payments from the Fed like a savings account.

Whenever the Fed sells assets to primary dealers, they sell to banks who already have a bank account with the Fed. Ultimately, the buyer's money is already parked at the Fed! So when the Fed sells securities (or allows them to mature without reinvesting), the Fed subtracts both its assets on its balance sheet and also subtracts the value from the bank's reserve account at the Fed, which cancels each other out and effectively destroys that portion of the monetary base.

The difference here is that the Fed will still receive interest payments on these assets for the remainder of their duration as they would normally. The most realistic scenario is that these funds are then used to pay for interest on reserves parked at the Fed, so normal bank operations can continue for a time. 

However, unless the Fed finds another way to make money, the interest on reserves rate can be expected to gradually drop over the next 30 years. That's more than enough time for the banks to figure out what to do with their reserves. Let's go a little deeper into some of the expected outcomes here...

## Inflationary vs Deflationary Pressures
One outcome of this arrangement is that this would likely spur an increase in business investment by banks. The interest on reserves paid by the Fed has always acted to limit bank investing in the open market. 

Think about it from the bank's perspective: why would I go make a risky investment into some startup or business which could default as soon as it hits rough waters, when I could just park my assets at the Fed and make a cool, risk-free 4.4%? [(current IORB Rate)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IORB) 

>So basically, the Fed has been paying banks to not loan you money.

As the IORB rate declines with time, and the Fed's interest payments become far less risk-free as they're forced to deal with competitive market pressures, banks will be forced to revisit business investments. They may put pressure on regulators to revisit usury laws which prevent them charging higher interest rates on startups (*VC firms currently fill this void*). 

This new pressure on banks to find alternative investment opportunities will create a counteractive inflationary pressure to combat the inherently deflationary pressure of ending the Federal Reserve and soften the shock to the system.
